Congratulations! You just found another personal page written by a software engineer.

There is nothing here but my two little kittens.

<div style="overflow: hidden; display: flex; justify-content:space-around;">
    <img style="max-width: 50%;padding:5px"
      src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/xigua.jpg" />
    <img style="max-width: 50%;padding:5px"
      src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/caomei.jpg" />
</div>

Oh, you are saying me? I'm just an ordinary software engineer you'd probably come across the internet everyday given the truth that you clicked into my site.

Anyway here is a skill pie chart that generated from my Github page that might give you some impression about me.

Or you can go to my [blog](https://blog.leishi.io/) to see if there is some thing interest.

<div class="skills-svg">
